# Vision

UniHack was founded by a group of friends in December of 2013 in Tbilisi, Georgia. We are an awesome team of hackers who decided to spread the hackathon storm to our part of the planet because we believe that Georgian students are true hackers and the world needs them.

Our goal is to spread the hacker culture in our region and get more and more cities and countries involved. We are turning Georgia into a home for hackers from all around the world. We are turning Georgia into a place where great people meet each other, build awesome things together and make the world a better place. 

##Core Values
Since the very first day we believe in these core values and this is what our community and its future stands on:

* Love of Building Things.

>One single most important thing our team and community have in common is the passion and love of building things every single day.


* Humbleness

>One of the most amazing things you realize during the hackathon is that there's so much to learn and how everyone's talent and experience is invaluable and unique. 

* Willingness to Help Others and Get Help from Others

>Everyone has something to learn. Hackathons are full of awesome people with different skills and experiences. Sharing the knowledge and experience to each other is what drives our community.  

* Create Experiences

>Every single hackathon and every single person you meet there can change your life for ever. We inspire each other. 

* Boldness

>We understand that the path we chose is not an easy one. But we get bored by doing easy things. We know we're gonna face a lot of challenges. Lot of disappointment. But, we are fearless because we love what we do, we are fearless because we are together in this, we are fearless because that's the only option we got.
